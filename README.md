## 👨‍💻About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cardinal117
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and pretty much anything tech-related.
- This is just a showcase of my website I am messing around with. I will probably add new things I find fun and funny every so often.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack web development and software engineering.

## 📌Project Description

The project showcases the use of SCSS, HTML, and some JavaScript to create a fresh-looking website with animations that make the website feel alive.

## 💾📂How to Install

1. Download the project files.
2. Locate and double-click the `index.html` file.
3. The website should open in your default web browser, allowing you to see the website and use all of its functions.

### 🛠️Example Pages:
- **The first page should look like this:**

- **The games page should look like this:**

- **Playground page display**

  - **Second change:**

## 🚀Usage

- You can browse through each section of the website and use the table of contents to quickly navigate to different sections.
- The buttons at the top of the header/page can be clicked on to navigate to other webpages.
- Almost all elements on the Home page and all on the Games page can be saved for later(by clicking the save for later button). This will save the elements to another page labled Saves to view for later.
- Comments can be added at the bottom of the home page to share your thoughts and you can like said comment.
- The Playground page is where I will add/remove/modify or change animations or effects just to test it out and improve my skills.

## 🛠️Future Updates

- At this moment it will just be some extra animations or effects added to the playground page.
- Some background elements will be modified and improved to increase performance and make me feel happier about my code.

- 💡Let me know what extra features or effects I should add in the future, I will try my very best to implement it in some way.
