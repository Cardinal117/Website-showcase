      <h1 class="main-heading">Creating Games:</h1>
      <p>
        Game development by definition is to simply create games from the ground
        up but I see it as so much more than than. Game development in my eyes
        is a type of art mixing various elements together to make a masterpiece
        mending your thoughts and dreams together in one place.
      </p>

      <section id="planning">
      <div class="savable-item">
        <h2>Planning and Brainstorming:</h2>
        <p>
          This is the first step in creating a game. This is where you decide on
          what glorious ideas you want to include, achieve, create, and even
          improve on. This part of game development will consist of
        </p>

        <ul class="default-list">
          <li>Thinking of a game concept.</li>
          <li>Thinking of a storyline.</li>
          <li>Thinking of unique features to keep players engaged.</li>
          <li>Thinking of gameplay attributes to make the game stand out.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
        <p>
          You can easily get carried away with this step as you can think of
          just about anything. This also means that you should watch out for
          creating a too ambitious game that you you won't be able to complete.

      <section id="design-document">
        <h2>The Game Design Document:</h2>
        <p>
          The Game Design Document is a very important and incredibly useful
          document that you create to log all of your ideas and it also has all
          the technical details for your game such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="default-list">
          <li>Which game engine to use.</li>
          <li>What development tools services to use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The GDD will also include:</p>
        <ul class="default-list">
          <li>
            Visual concepts showing and illustrating the main idea of the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            The interactions, designs and also the presentation of the
            characters in the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            The design, theme, environment and type of world design for the
            game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designs of the levels and detailed information on the levels and
            ideas.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The GDD is a document that grows with your development of your game,
          it can start out as a few ideas and evolve into a massively detailed
          document that will help you and your team to create the game you want
          to make.

      <section id="designing">
        <h2>Design and style choices:</h2>
        <p>
          The design and style choices are what make the game feel unique and
          interesting to play, this is where you bring your ideas to life and
          make them a reality. You will be transforming your ideas into game
          assets for you to use withing your game. Your choice of style will
          also affect the mood and feel of the game, for example a dark and
          gloomy style will make the game feel more serious and intense whereas
          a bright and colorful style will make the game feel more light-hearted
          and fun.

        <h2>Coding the game to life:</h2>
        <p>
          The Coding phase is what some people view as the scariest part of game
          development but, it is my favorite part. The fun to be had to craft
          your game mechanics using logical thinking is truly immense. You will
          be learning new and exciting ways to create certain skills or the perfect 
          magic system and make the gameplay feel truly alive and exciting to play. 
          This is where you will need to spend most of your time fine tuning the player
          controller, the enemies, the levels mechanics and other small little
          details others will appreciate.

      <h2>Some quotes to inspire:</h2>
      <p>
        “Gamers can feel when developers are passionate about their games. They
        can smell it like a dog smells fear. Don't be afraid to hold onto your
        unique vision: just be aware that it may not turn out exactly how you
        envisioned.” ― Scott Rogers, Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game
        Design
      </p>
      <p>
        A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever.” – Shigeru Miyamoto
      </p>
      <p>
        "A lot of indie developers who became 'Overnight Successes' were working at it for ten years." - Dan Adelman
